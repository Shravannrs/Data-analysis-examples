Welcome to my Github portfolio. I am Shravann Ramamurthy Shankar and I am a data analyst who finished my masters degree in Data Science and Analytics from the University of Leeds. 
I am very passinate about data analytics and have always been curious about finding weird trends and insights that might not be visible to the naked eye but will blow everyone's minds when identified and analysed.
I am harworking, fast learning, creative, friendly, approachable, driven, analytic, methodical and attentive to detail and everything that matters.
Feel free to go through my portfolio to know about my data analytical skills.
